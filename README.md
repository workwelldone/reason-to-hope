I love to hike, ride my bike, play fun music, inspire, hope, love, and serve.  I love to make things useful, solve intense problems, use focused concentration, and make life feel good.  With all the work, I want to look at things like little children do, finding joy in the wonder that is all around. 

I love solving problems using the computer.  I hope I will never lose my fascination with it.
