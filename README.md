I love to hike, ride my bike, create music, play, inspire, hope, love, and serve others with kindness.  I love to make things useful, solve intense problems, use focused concentration, and make life feel good.  With all the work, I like to look at things as children do, finding joy in the wonder that is all around. 

I love solving problems using the computer and am endlessly fascinated by it's power and capacity for creativity.  I enjoy striving to manage complexity, stay organized, persistently work through problems, and finally succeed at reaching the goals.
